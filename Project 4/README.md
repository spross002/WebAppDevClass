**All code for Project 4 - Places List with Map (Due April 20, 2023)**

- This project is an implementation of a places list, with an interactive map that adds and removes markers based on the data from the places db
- This code can be run using Node JS after running npm install, and is accessed using localhost:8080 in a web browser.
- In order for this to run, there must be a (.env) file with no name to specify the database path (DBPATH=./places.db)
