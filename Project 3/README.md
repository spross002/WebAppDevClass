**All code for Project 3 - Contact List Website With Style (Due April 5, 2023)**

- This project is an extension of project 2 with the addition of styling with Bootstrap (specifically 5).
- This is the first time I used CSS to style a website
- This code can be run using Node JS after running npm install, and is accessed using localhost:8080 in a web browser.
- In order for this to run, there must be a (.env) file with no name to specify the database path (DBPATH=./p3.db)
